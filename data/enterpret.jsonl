\\u25e6 This confusion is prevalent among users, leading to difficulties in project management.\", \"29\": \"&gt; \\n&gt; \\n&gt; Which, is fine but of course gives me no context as to why or what they are trying to achieve.\", \"30\": \"&gt; But, I was also a little surprised to see only *2 FeedBack Records (over 12mth period)* :thinking_face:\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I do like that it pulls in Community Slack records - would this act as a permanent store for this data?\", \"31\": \"(that alone could be worth the cost)\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Over in Quantify:\\n&gt; I tried filtering on Keywords like \\u2018Google calendar\\u2019 and \\u2018API\\u2019 - all <<STRICT_LINK> saw was a lot of support conversations>, which are not particularly useful to me.\", \"32\": \"&gt;

\\n&gt; Also, not really sure how this ties into a Feature Request system.\", \"34\": \"There\\u2019s something appealing to me to know we have requests logged somewhere, ideally with some Product thinking notes jotted down but crucially with some verbatim comments from customers.\", \"35\": \"If this is going to reinterpret the results everytime and pull out maybe that\\u2019s a good thing but it\\u2019s going to be hard to grasp what a \\u2018request\\u2019 is.\", \"36\": \"&gt; I\\u2019m impressed with the concept of searching for terms and then being able to filter results to get to a data set that you can then dig into.\", \"37\": \"If we are searching on the full range of user feedback from all tools as it looks to be that\\u2019s very powerful and a huge timesaver right there.\", \"38\": \"&gt; \\n&gt; My main concerns are:\\n&gt; \\u2022 Confidence that we are searching all data sources and not missing anything\\n&gt; \\u2022 Confidence that the AI is interpreting feedback as we would.\", \"39\": \"I found that when I put a csv of user feedback through ChatGPT (for rates) and asked it to group the themes and tally them it struggled to do this as well as one of us would.\", \"40\": \"It was likely lacking a lot of context around the terms we use for the app, industry terms and then oftentimes a word means something different in the sentence because resource, planning, calendar.. they can all be applied in very different contexts.\", \"41\": \"&gt; \\u2022 LOE to keep it well fed with data and context.\", \"42\": \"Who owns this?\", \"43\": \"&gt; \\u2022 How it connects to feature requests.\", \"44\": \"&gt; \\n&gt; \\n&gt; On the last point, connecting to feature requests, could we import our feature requests list from Linear and then have the AI link any relevant feedback to each request in Enterpret?\", \"45\": \"Then we could pull up a feature request in Enterpret and see all the related user feedback including the customers that have requested it.\", \"46\": \"If we can then dismiss inaccurate links, presumably the model can improve at making good connections?\", \"47\": \"&gt; \\n&gt; Would be pretty cool if that is integrated so person adds a feature request in Linear, Enterpret auto-links all relevant user feedback to the request (in Enterpret), then it\\u2019s all their ready when we evaluate the request.\", \"48\": \"&gt; Looks pretty slick!\", \"49\": \"I was looking for feedback related to Placeholders yesterday and it was very helpful.\", \"50\": \"&gt; \\u2022 It\\u2019s great you can open Intercom &amp; Gong conversations and have the relevant conversation part immediately available\\n&gt; \\u2022 It did seem like we need to do some gardening/add some data sources but I\\u2019m very impressed seeing this v1 experience\\n&gt; \\u2022 The ability to search and filter by sentiment, customer/company attributes (like MRR), is huuuuuuge :raised_hands:\\n&gt; \\u2022 Importing everything seems to create some noise (e.g.\", \"51\": \"I don\\u2019t need to see all the feedback about payment declines) but it looks like we can filter that out and create dashboards ourselves\\n&gt; \\u25e6 It looks like it\\u2019s importing Intercom conversation tags which we could use to setup a process with CS to help here\", \"52\": \"Agent: <<STRICT_LINK>>\"}"}
